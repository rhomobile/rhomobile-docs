Installing the Heroku command-line tool
=======================================

The `heroku` command-line tool is an interface to the Heroku Web API and
includes support for things like creating/renaming apps, running rake commands,
taking backups, and configuring add-ons. Most app management activities require
the `heroku` command to be installed and configured alongside your local
working environment.

The command-line tool also has a plugin architecture that allows developers to 
extend the functionality of the command.

Installation
------------

[Sign-up for a Heroku account](http://heroku.com/signup) if you haven't already
and then install the "heroku" gem. You will be asked to enter your Heroku
credentials the first time you run a command. 

    :::term
    $ sudo gem install heroku

It's general a good idea to add your public key immediately after installing the
heroku gem so that you can use git to push or clone Heroku app repositories:

    :::term
    $ heroku keys:add
    Enter your Heroku credentials.
    Email: joe@example.com
    Password: 
    Uploading ssh public key /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Usage
-----

Running `heroku help` displays a usage summary:

    :::term
    $ heroku help

    db:reset                     # reset the database for the app

    bundles                      # list bundles for the app
    bundles:capture [<bundle>]   # capture a bundle of the app's code and data

    === Plugins

    plugins                      # list installed plugins
    plugins:install <url>        # install the plugin from the specified git url
    plugins:uninstall <url/name> # remove the specified plugin

    === Example:

     rails myapp
     cd myapp
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "my new app"
     heroku create
     git push heroku master

The commands are divided into two types: general commands and app commands.

### General Commands

General commands operate on your Heroku account as a whole, and are not specific
to a particular app.  For instance, to get a list of apps you created or are a
collaborator on:

    :::term
    $ heroku list
    fooapp
    barapp
    yetanotherapp

### App Commands

App commands are typically executed from within an app's local git working copy.
The app name is automatically detected by scanning the git remotes for the
current working copy, so you don't have to specify which app to operate on
explicitly. For example, the `heroku info` command can be executed without any
arguments inside the working copy:

    :::term
    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku info
    === myapp
    Web URL:        http://myapp.heroku.com/
    Git Repo:       git@heroku.com:myapp.git
    Repo size:      960k
    Slug size:      512k
    Data size:      88k in 3 tables
    Collaborators:  you@example.com

If you have multiple heroku remotes or want to execute an app command outside of
a local working copy, you can specify an explicit app name, domain, or git
remote as follows:

    :::term
    $ heroku info --app myapp
    $ heroku info --app www.example.com
    $ heroku info --remote staging

Plugins
-------

Plugins allow developers to extend the functionality of the Heroku command interface, adding commands or features.
    :::term
    === Plugins
    plugins                      # list installed plugins
    plugins:install <url>        # install the plugin from the specified git url
    plugins:uninstall <url/name> # remove the specified plugin


### Installing Plugin

To install a plugin, you need to know the git url for the plugin.  Use the heroku plugins:install command, and specify the git repo:

    :::term
    $ heroku plugins:install git://github.com/hone/heroku_colorize_console.git

### List plugins

To see a list of currently installed plugins:

    :::term
    $ heroku plugins
    heroku_tab_complete_console
	
### Removing Plugins

    :::term
    $ heroku plugins:uninstall heroku_tab_complete_console

### List of available plugins

[Herocutter](http://herocutter.heroku.com/) is a one stop shop for all plugins.  It makes it easy to find and install Heroku plugins.

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Command not found

On some machines your path may not be set correctly to run binary gems.  If you get a command not found error, you need to add the rubygems executable directory to your path.  You can find the EXECUTABLE_DIRECTORY by running

    :::term
    $ gem environment
    
And then setting your path to include the appropriate directory:

    :::term
    $ export PATH=/opt/ruby-enterprise-1.8.6-20090201/bin:$PATH
