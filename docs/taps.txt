Database import / export
========================

Installing Taps
---------------

The [Taps](http://adam.blog.heroku.com/past/2009/2/11/taps_for_easy_database_transfers/)
project provides a fast, easy, single-step way to get databases of any size in and
out of Heroku. Taps allows you to push and pull databases from your local system
(or another hosting environment) directly to and from your Heroku app's database.

The `heroku` command-line tool uses Taps internally to perform database
transfers. The `taps` gem must be installed before running any of the commands
described below:

    sudo gem install taps

Import: Push to Heroku
----------------------

Use `db:push` when you wish to transfer an existing database to Heroku.  For
example, a SQLite database that you've been working with in local development;
or a MySQL database you have deployed on another host.

Your app should be deployed to Heroku in [the usual way](/quickstart).  From
within your local checkout of the deployed app:

    :::term
    $ heroku db:push
    Sending schema
    Sending data
    users:         100% |==============================================| Time: 00:00:00
    pages:         100% |==============================================| Time: 00:00:00
    comments:      100% |==============================================| Time: 00:00:00
    tags:          100% |==============================================| Time: 00:00:00
    Sending indexes
    Resetting sequences

This pushes the contents (schema, data, indexes, sequences) of whatever database
is specified in `config/database.yml` to Heroku.

If you don't have a `config/database.yml` (for example, if you're using Sequel
or DataMapper in a Sinatra app), you can specify a database URL on the command
line. Some examples:

    :::term
    $ heroku db:push sqlite://local.db
    $ heroku db:push mysql://root:mypass@localhost/mydb
    $ heroku db:push postgres://postgres:mypass@remotehost/mydb

Export: Pull from Heroku
------------------------

Use `db:pull` when you wish to export the contents of your Heroku app's
database. Some uses include backups, local debugging, or to move the app's
deployment location.

From within a local checkout of your Rails or Merb app which is deployed to
Heroku:

    :::term
    $ heroku db:pull
    Receiving schema
    Receiving data
    8 tables, 591 records
    users:         100% |==============================================| Time: 00:00:00
    pages:         100% |==============================================| Time: 00:00:00
    comments:      100% |==============================================| Time: 00:00:00
    tags:          100% |==============================================| Time: 00:00:00
    Receiving indexes
    Resetting sequences

This pulls the contents (schema, data, indexes, sequences) of the remote Heroku
database down into a local database specified in `config/database.yml`, or at
the database URL provided as an argument as described in the previous section.

Additional Use Cases
--------------------

### Host-to-Host Database Transfer

When importing to Heroku from an existing host (like EC2, Slicehost, or
your own co-located server), it will be fastest if you can run the import
straight from that machine. To do that, you'll need to install the Heroku
client gem and enter your username/password on that machine. If you can't
or don't wish to import straight from that host, another option is to transfer
the database to your local machine first (via the typical `mysqldump`/`scp`/`mysql`,
or with the `taps` gem) and then run the `heroku db:push` command from there.

### Debugging

db:pull is very useful for debugging production data.  For example, you
might have a user contact you about a corrupted record.  You could run
db:pull to get a local copy of the database, fix the remote record (via
`heroku console`), then inspect the corrupted data locally at your leisure.

### Backups

`db:pull` can be used for backups, although it will be much slower than
downloading a captured bundle.  But if you don't mind the longer transfer
time, having it in a SQL database format of your choice may be superior,
since you can quickly query the backed-up data in cases such as recovery of
a few accidentally-deleted records.
