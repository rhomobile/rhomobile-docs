Frequently Asked Questions
===

This page describes how to perform various functions using the Rhodes / RhoSync frameworks and RhoHub.

## How do I write "Hello, world" in Rhodes?
Edit the `app/index.erb` to create some content:
	
	:::html
	<div class="toolbar">
	  <h1 id="pageTitle">
	    Small demo app
	  </h1>
	</div>

	<ul id="home" selected="true" title="Hello">
	  <li><a href="another.erb">Hello, world which links to another page</a></li>
	</ul>

## How do I add an OK button to my app?
The generated code from running (`rhodes model <modelname> <attributelist>`) contains several samples. Here's a smaller fragment.
	 
	:::html
	<form method="POST" action="<%= url_for(:action =>:update) %>">
	<input type="submit" value="OK"/>
	</form>

## How do I insert a picture icon next to an element?
Adding to the above example:
	
	:::html
	<ul id="home" selected="true" title="Hello">
	  <li><a href="another.erb"><img src="/public/images/bluebutton.png"></a></li>
	</ul>

## How do I call a web service and process the returned data?

This is done with [`AsyncHttp`](/rhodes/connect-to-web-services).  You will then use either JSON (if its a JSON web service) or REXML (if the web service returns XML) to process the data. 

See the [`AsyncHttp` example code](/rhodes/connect-to-web-services#asynchttp-example) which connects to an XML feed at <a href="http://rhostore.heroku.com/products.xml"/> and parses it with rexml.

## How do I make a POST request to webservice?
To make a POST request, use the `AsyncHttp.post` method.  See the [`AsyncHttp.post` docs here](/rhodes/connect-to-web-services#asynchttp-api).


## Can I process XML with Rhodes?
Yes, first add the following to your `build.yml`:

	:::yaml
	extensions: ["rexml", "set"]

Now parse the xml in your controller action:

	:::ruby
	require 'rexml/document'
	file = File.new("bibliography.xml")
	doc = REXML::Document.new(file)
	puts doc

If you are planning to run your app on Blackberry, you should use the [`RhoXml` extension](/rhodes/extensions#rhodes-extensions). It has the same syntax as rexml, but has limited functionality and a much smaller memory footprint.  Enable it in your application by adding to `build.yml`:

	:::ruby
  	extensions: ["rhoxml"]

Now parse the xml in your controller action:
	require 'rexml/document'
	file = File.new("bibliography.xml")
	doc = REXML::Document.new(file)
	puts doc

If you have a very large XML document to parse, you should use the [XML stream parser extension](/rhodes/extensions#rhodes-extensions).

## How can I seed a large amount of data into my application with Rhom?
You can either use the [built-in Rhom functions](/rhodes/rhom#seeding-the-database) or use a database transaction:

	:::ruby
	db = ::Rho::RHO.get_src_db('Model')
	db.start_transaction
	begin
	  items.each do |item|
		# create hash of attribute/value pairs
	    data = {
		  :field1 => item['value1'], 
		  :field2 => item['value2'] 
		} 
		# Creates a new Model object and saves it
	    new_item = Model.create(data)
	  end
	 db.commit
	rescue
	 db.rollback
	end

*NOTE: If ::Rho::RHO.get_src_db('Model') return nil, it means that you never call this models methods before(models are loaded by demand). To fix it call 'require_source': *

	:::ruby
    require_source 'Model'  


## How can I create a lot of objects in controller action?
When controller action is called Ruby Garbage Collector is disabled. If you create a lot of objects enable GC at the beginning of action:

    :::ruby
    def my_objects_generator
        GC.enable
        #Do some heavy operations
    end  

To avoid UI block while controller action is performed, use AsyncHttp to make operation asynchronously(Local server will be blocked, but Html and Javacript does not):
    :::ruby
    def start_objects_generator
        #callback has to be provided, overwise operation will be syncronouse
        AsyncHttp.get( :url => url_for(:action => do_objects_generation), :callback => (url_for :action => :generation_callback) )
        render page_with_progress_updated_by_javascript
    end  
    
    def do_objects_generation
        GC.enable
        #Do some heavy operations
        
        #do not call render here, call WebView.navigate or do it in  generation_callback      
    end
    
    def generation_callback
        WebView.navigate ( url_for :action => :show_results  )
    end
     
## How do I customize the app name and icons?
Follow the [build section on setting the application name and icon](/rhodes/build#how-to-set-application-name-and-icon).

## How to improve application perfomance on Blackberry?
* Before test application for perfomance set warning log level in rhoconfig.txt:

        MinSeverity = 3
    
* Database is most critical part for perfomance improvement. See [Database Perfomance Tips](/rhodes/rhom#perfomance-tips)
* If possible, do not use complex regular expressions - they slow works slow on Blackberry
* If possible, do not use images in html body(single or tiled) - use solid color
* If possible, do not use Exceptions to implement application logic. Add check for null parameters instead of catch Exception.
* If possible, do not use Date/Time parse method. Use strptime instead. Use time as number when possible
* Move require of big ruby files to methods when they used. This is true for locally used classes. Add system check for platform dependent code.
* Exclude unused files from build(images, libraries etc). It will decrease application size and improve startup perfomance.Edit build.yml:
      excludedirs: 
      bb: 
      - public/images/iphone
      - public/images/android
* To parse XML use Stream parser: XML handling:XML Stream parser see - [Rhodes Extensions](/rhodes/extensions#rhodes-extensions)

## White screen between pages
It takes a bit of time for WebView to load and parse html/css of your page; meanwhile WebView show empty page which is white by default. Try setting default background color of the toolbar to the color of your pages:
	:::ruby
	Rho::NativeToolbar.create( :buttons => toolbar, 
		:background_color => 0x0000FF )
Please see more details about toolbar [here](/rhodes/ui#native-toolbar-control)

If you are loading javascript, consider doing it at the very end of your page; this way WebView will not wait for JS before parsing css and showing html. 

## How to pre-populate client database
* Run application on target emulator, insert objects to database(locally or get data from server)
* Copy all files from 'db' folder on emulator to '<rhodes>/platform\shared\db\res\db'. Here is how to find 'db' emulator folder:
    * iPhone: look inside log to find paths with guid - this is there application store files on emulator. Or run search by 'syncdbuser.sqlite' from disk root
    * Android: difficult since emulator is virtual machine and files stored inside emulator. Use adb command line to find path to application package
    * Windows Mobile: open device explorer from ActiveSync or 'Mobile Device center', navigate to 'Program Files/<application name>/rho/db'
    * Blackberry: open on computer file system  - '<jde>/components/simulator/sdcard/Rho/<appname>/db
* Build application, now all db files are in the application package

## How to remove toolbar from top-level index.erb
Edit app/application.rb file: initialize method

    :::ruby
    class AppApplication < Rho::RhoApplication
      
      def initialize
        #To remove default toolbar uncomment next line:
        #it should be before super
        @@toolbar = nil    
        
        super
      end
    end  

## How to define controller for top-level index.erb
There is no way to define controller for top-level index.erb, so create special model and put index.erb there:

* Create special 'Home' model
* in rhoconfig.txt modify 'start_path' :

        start_path = '/app/Home'
    
* 'Home' model index method:

        def index
            #do something
            render
        end
        
## How to print document in Rhodes
* Prepare file with printed content (html, pdf, image, etc.)
* Open this file by 

    System.open_url(file_path)
    
* Print document from document application

## How to use native Google map view on Android

* Get [Google Maps API key](http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html)
* Add 'mapping' and 'apikey' parameters to your build.yml
    
        android:
            mapping: yes
            apikey: <YOUR-API-KEY>

* Add 'network_state' to capabilities list in your build.yml.

        capabilities:
            - network_state

## How to optimize memory usage in Rhodes
There are several Rhodes components which consume system memory( list order by memory consumptions, bigger first):

### Internet Browser

Use system memory and a lot of graphics objects to display content. Rhodes Turn on Cache in Browser for static files like images, css, javascript etc

Tips to optimize Browser performance and memory consumption:

* Use simple css and javascript frameworks
* Do not display big lists with images on one page: use pagination

### Ruby Virtual Machine

Use system memory. Here is the notes about RubyVM memory usage:

*	When application bundle creates ruby files compiled to internal format(iseq), so at runtime RubyVM work with precompiled files and do not perform ruby text parsing
*	RubyVM hold required Ruby files in memory. All required files keeps in memory till application exit
*	RubyVM allocate memory application objects. All global and class variables will remain in memory till you nil them
*	Controller object allocates/deallocates for each controller method request. So you cannot keep persistent information in Controller object
*	Ruby Garbage Collector works automatically. But to improve performance and stability GC is disabled before controller action and enabled after controller action exit. So if you allocate/deallocate a lot of Ruby objects in controller action: call GC.enable at the beginning.
*	Rhodes loads only framework ruby files at startup, all other libraries loads by demand including models 

Tips to optimize RubyVM performance and memory consumption:

*	Load only required libraries
*	Do not load all ruby files at start: it will slow down application startup time. Load them by demand
*	Do not use big global or class variables. Keep persistent objects in database

###	Sqlite database

Use system memory.  Here is the notes about Sqlite memory usage:

* In some cases it may take more memory then Ruby VM : it depends of the database size. 
* Rhodes use unchanged Sqlite, so all documentation about Sqlite memory usage are correct for Rhodes Sqlite database. 
* Here is the [database perfomance tips](http://edgedocs.rhomobile.com/rhodes/rhom#perfomance-tips)

###	Native controls like TabBar, Toolbar, Map etc

Use System memory and graphics objects.

Tips to optimize Native Controls performance and memory consumption:

*	Use low resolution camera images
*	Do not put large amount of pins to one map view
