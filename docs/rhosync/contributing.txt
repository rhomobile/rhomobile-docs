Contributing to RhoSync
===
Want to add features to RhoSync?  Found a bug that you want report or fix?  Please follow the steps below to help with the RhoSync project.  Thanks to developers like you, RhoSync continues to be the best and fastest open-source mobile sync server!

## Report RhoSync Issues
Please first report bugs/features/enhancements to the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/rhomobile).  Someone may already be working on the issue!

## Run RhoSync Specs
First run the rhosync specs to make sure your environment is up-to-date for development:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) the [RhoSync repository](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhosync).

2. Clone your new repo: 
		
		:::term
		$ git clone git://github.com/<yourhandle>/rhosync.git
		$ cd rhosync

2. Install [Jeweler](http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler):
		
		:::term
		$ gem install jeweler

3. Jeweler comes with useful tasks to identify missing development dependencies.  Run it and install any missing gems it reports:
		
		:::term
		$ rake check_dependencies

4. Install [hsqldata](http://github.com/rhomobile/hsqldata):
		
		:::term
		$ git clone git://github.com/rhomobile/hsqldata.git
		$ cd hsqldata
		$ ant
		$ mkdir -p <path-to-rhosync>/vendor/
		$ cp bin/hsqldata.jar <path-to-rhosync>/vendor/

5. Run the RhoSync specs:

		:::term
 		$ rake   #=> runs all rhosync specs by default


If everything passes (pending specs are OK), then your environment is ready for development.  If you have trouble installing a particular gem or the specs just won't run properly, please feel free to ping the [rhomobile google group](mailto:rhomobile@googlegroups.com) or [hop on IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rhomobile) to chat with other RhoSync developers.

## Contributing your Patch
Now that you're environment is ready, make your changes!

1. Create a topic branch:
		
		:::term

2. Write tests ([example](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhosync/commit/f95cfdbf3f53d64c3957499906c77d7127b7c3db#diff-2))
