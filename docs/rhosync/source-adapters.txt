RhoSync Source Adapters
===

Connecting to a backend service with RhoSync requires that you write a small amount of Ruby code for the query, create, update and delete operations of your particular enterprise backend. The collection of the Ruby code for these operations we refer to as a "source" or "source adapter".

## Generate Source Adapter

Adding a new source adapter to your RhoSync application is simple:
  	
	:::term
	$ cd storeserver
  	$ rhosync source product

This will generate a new ruby class called `sources/product.rb`:

	:::ruby
	class Product < SourceAdapter
	  def initialize(source)
	    super(source)
	  end
 
	  def login
	    # TODO: Login to your data source here if necessary
	  end
 
	  def query
	    # TODO: Query your backend data source and assign the records 
	    # to a nested hash structure called @result. For example:
	    # @result = { 
	    #   "1"=>{"name"=>"Acme", "industry"=>"Electronics"},
	    #   "2"=>{"name"=>"Best", "industry"=>"Software"}
	    # }
	    raise SourceAdapterException.new("Please provide some code to read records from the backend data source")
	  end
 
	  def sync
	    super
	  end
 
	  def create(create_hash,blob=nil)
	    # TODO: Create a new record in your backend data source
	    # If your rhodes rhom object contains image/binary data 
	    # (has the image_uri attribute), then a blob will be provided
	    raise "Please provide some code to create a single record in the backend data source using the create_hash"
	  end
 
	  def update(update_hash)
	    # TODO: Update an existing record in your backend data source
	    raise "Please provide some code to update a single record in the backend data source using the update_hash"
	  end
 
	  def delete(delete_hash)
	    # TODO: write some code here if applicable
	    # be sure to have a hash key and value for "object"
	    # for now, we'll say that its OK to not have a delete operation
	    # raise "Please provide some code to delete a single object in the backend application using the object_id"
	  end
 
	  def logoff
	    # TODO: Logout from the data source if necessary
	  end
	end

It also adds a spec file `spec/sources/product_spec.rb` and updates `settings/settings.yml` with the product adapter to the sources section with some default options:

 	:::yaml
	:sources: 
  	  Product: 
    	:poll_interval: 300

## Source Adapter API
The source adapter interface is described below, your source adapter can use any of these methods to interact with your backend service.

### `login`
Login to your backend service (optional).

	:::ruby
	def login
	  MyWebService.login(current_user.login)
	end

### `logoff`
Logoff from your backend service (optional).

	:::ruby
	def logoff
	  MyWebService.logoff(current_user.login)
	end

### `query(params = nil)`
Query your backend service and build a hash of hashes (required).

**NOTE: This method must assign `@result` to a hash of hashes.  If @result is `nil` or `{}`, the master document will be erased from redis.**

	:::ruby
	def query
	  parsed = JSON.parse(RestClient.get("#{@base}.json").body)

      @result = {}
	  parsed.each do |item|
	    @result[item["product"]["id"].to_s] = item["product"]
	  end if parsed
	end

### `search(params)`
Search your backend based on params and build a hash of hashes (optional).  Similar to query, however the master document accumulates the data in `@result` instead of replacing when it runs.

	:::ruby
	def search(params)
	  parsed = JSON.parse(RestClient.get("#{@base}.json").body)

      @result = {}
	  parsed.each do |item|
		if item["product"]["name"].downcase == params['name'].downcase
	      @result[item["product"]["id"].to_s] = item["product"]
	    end
	  end if parsed
	end

Next, you will need to add search to your Rhodes application. For details, see the [Rhodes search section](/rhodes/synchronization#filtering-datasets-with-search).
	
### `create(create_hash)`
Create a new record in the backend (optional).

**NOTE: RhoSync can establish a 'link' between the local record id provided by the client and the new record id provided by the backend service.  To enable this link, return the new record id as a string.**

	:::ruby
	def create(create_hash)
	  res = MyWebService.create(create_hash)

	  # return new product id so we establish a client link
	  res.new_id
	end

### `update(update_hash)`
Update an existing record in the backend (optional).

	:::ruby
	def update(update_hash)
	end

### `delete(delete_hash)`
Delete an existing record in the backend (optional).

	:::ruby
	def delete(delete_hash)
	  MyWebService.delete(delete_hash['id'])
	end
	
### `current_user`
Returns the current user which called the adapter.  For example, you could filter results for a specific user in  your query method:

	:::ruby
	def query
	  @result = MyWebService.get_records_for_user(current_user.login)
	end
	
### `stash_result`
Saves the current state of `@result` to redis and assigns it to `nil`.  Typically this is used when your adapter has to paginate through backend service data.

 	:::ruby
	def query
	  @result = {}
	  ('a'..'z').each_with_index do |letter,i|
		@result ||= {}
	    @result.merge!( DictionaryService.get_records_for(letter) )
		stash_result if i % 2
	  end
	end

## Data Partitioning
Data is stored in RhoSync using [redis sets](http://redis.io/commands#set).  The `@result` hash from the `query` method is stored in redis and referred to as the Master Document or MD.  

The MD is referenced in RhoSync by a corresponding partition.  Source adapters can partition data in two ways: user and app.  As you might have guessed, user partitioning stores a copy of the source adapter MD for each user (one copy shared across all devices for a user).  

Likewise, app partitioning stores one copy of the source adapter MD for the entire application (all users and devices share the same data).  App partitioning can be particularly useful if you have source adapters which retrieve large amounts of data that is fixed from user to user, for example a global product catalog.  Using app partitioning wherever possible ***greatly reduces*** the amount of data in redis.

### User Partition
User partitioning is the default scheme for source adapters, however you can explicitly define it in `settings/settings.yml` with:

	:::yaml
	:sources: 
  	  Product: 
    	:poll_interval: 300
    	:partition_type: user

### App Partition
Enable app partitioning the same way:
	
	:::yaml
	:sources: 
  	  Product: 
    	:poll_interval: 300
    	:partition_type: app

Now you have a single copy of the `Product` source adapter dataset for all users.

## Store API
RhoSync provides a simple redis interface for saving/retrieving arbitrary data.  This is useful if you want to save data in your application to be used later (i.e. in an async job or a subsequent source adapter execution).

	:::ruby
	Store.put_value('hello','world')

	Store.get_value('hello') #=> 'world'

	# You can store nested hashes too!
	Store.put_data(
	  'mydata',
	  {
	    '1' => { 'hello' => 'world' }
	  }
	)

	Store.get_data('mydata') #=> { '1' => { 'hello' => 'world' } }
	
## Handling Exceptions
If your source adapter raises an instance of `SourceAdapterException`, the resulting message will be sent to the client's sync callback(in `@params['error_message']`).  See the rhodes [sync exception handling docs](/rhodes/synchronization#handling-exceptions) for more details.

You can use `SourceAdapterException` as a convenient way to notify your application of various error conditions.

For example, your delete method might check the web service HTTP response code was 200 to make sure the record was deleted:

	:::ruby
	def delete(delete_hash)   
	  rest_result = RestClient.delete("#{@base}/#{delete_hash['id']}")
	  if rest_result.code != 200
	    raise SourceAdapterException.new("Error deleting record.")
	  end
	end

**NOTE: When your adapter method raises an exception, no data is removed from the adapter's master document.**

The following exceptions are provided for convenience:

### `SourceAdapterLoginException`
Useful to raise in your adapter's login method if it failed.

### `SourceAdapterLogoffException`
Similar to login, raise this if your adapter's logoff failed.

### `SourceAdapterServerTimeoutException`
Raise if your backend service connection times out.

### `SourceAdapterServerErrorException`
Raise this if your backend service returns a non-successful response.


## Handling Conflicts

Handling conflicts in RhoSync follows the same pattern as handling exceptions.  Once your adapter method has detected a conflict, you can raise a `SourceAdapterObjectConflictError` which will be sent to your application's sync callback.

### `SourceAdapterObjectConflictError`
Raise this if your adapter has detected a conflict.

	:::ruby
	def update(update_hash) 
      obj_id = update_hash['id']
      update_hash.delete('id')   
      rest_result = RestClient.put("#{@base}/#{obj_id}",:product => update_hash)
	  if rest_result.code != 200
	    raise SourceAdapterObjectConflictError.new("Conflict detected updating the object.")
	  end
    end

## Sample Adapter
Here's a complete example of how the completed [product adapter might look](https://github.com/rhomobile/store-server/blob/master/sources/product.rb):

	:::ruby
	require 'json'
	require 'rest_client'

	class Product < SourceAdapter
  
	  def initialize(source)
	    @base = 'http://rhostore.heroku.com/products'
	    super(source)
	  end
 
	  def query(params=nil)
    	rest_result = RestClient.get("#{@base}.json").body

		if rest_result.code != 200
		  raise SourceAdapterException.new("Error connecting!")
		end
	    parsed = JSON.parse(rest_result)

	    @result={}
	    parsed.each do |item|
	      @result[item["product"]["id"].to_s] = item["product"]
	    end if parsed   
	  end
 
	  def create(create_hash)
	    res = RestClient.post(@base,:product => create_hash)
    
	    # After create we are redirected to the new record. 
	    # We need to get the id of that record and return 
		# it as part of create so rhosync can establish a link 
		# from its temporary object on the client to this newly 
		# created object on the server
	    JSON.parse(
		  RestClient.get("#{res.headers[:location]}.json").body
		)["product"]["id"]
	  end
 
	  def update(update_hash) 
	    obj_id = update_hash['id']
	    update_hash.delete('id')   
	    RestClient.put("#{@base}/#{obj_id}",:product => update_hash)
	  end
 
	  def delete(delete_hash)   
	    RestClient.delete("#{@base}/#{delete_hash['id']}")
	  end
	end
