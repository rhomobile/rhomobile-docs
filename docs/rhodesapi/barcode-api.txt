# Barcode API

Allows the device to recognize a barcode. See the controller and view in the /app/BarcodeRecognizer folder of the [System API Samples application](https://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes-system-api-samples/blob/master/app/BarcodeRecognizer/controller.rb) for an example.

## Enabling Barcode Recognition

You need to enable the camera on the device. Do this by adding that capability to the build.yml file:

	:::yaml
	capabilities:
	  - camera

On iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, and Blackberry (`iphone`, `android`, `wm`, `bb`), you need to add the barcode extension:

	:::yaml
	:iphone
	  extensions: ["barcode"]

## barcode_recognize

Recognizes a barcode on an image. Returns a string with recognized code, or emty string if the barcode is not recognized.

	:::ruby
	Barcode.barcode_recognize(image_file_full_path)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>image_file_full_path</code></td>
	<td>Path to the image that contains the barcode to be recognized.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## take_barcode

iPhone and Android only. Open a user interface for real-time barcode recognition from the device camera. If a barcode is found, the user can confirm barcode recognition, or continue to try to recognize the barcode. When the user confirms or cancels, the callback is called.

	:::ruby
	Barcode.take_barcode(url_for :action => :take_callback)

Android only. You can also use the front camera for take_barcode.

	:::ruby
	Barcode.take_barcode(url_for(:action => :take_callback), {:camera => 'front'})

The callback receives these parameters:

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>status</code></td>
	<td>OK or CANCEL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>barcode</code></td>
	<td>The string for the recognized barcode.</td>
</tr>
</table>
