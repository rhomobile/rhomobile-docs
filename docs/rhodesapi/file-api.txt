# File API

Allows access to the Rhodes file structure. Refer to [File System access in Device Capabilities](/rhodes/device-caps#file-system-access) for an example.

## binread

Reads a file (binread for images and other media) and returns its binary content.

	File.binread(fileName)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>fileName</code></td>
	<td>String. Name of the file to read.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## join

Joins two strings and returns them in one string.

	:::ruby
	File.join(string1, string2)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>string1, string2</code></td>
	<td>The two strings to join.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## new

Create a new file.

	:::ruby
	File.new(fileName)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>fileName</code></td>
	<td>String. Name of the file to create.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## open

	:::ruby
	File.open(fileName)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>fileName</code></td>
	<td>String. Name of the file to open.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## write

	:::ruby
	File.write(content)

<table border="1">
