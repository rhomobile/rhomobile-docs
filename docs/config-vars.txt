Config vars
===========

A given codebase may have numerous deployments: a production site, a staging site, and one could even count each of the developers' local checkouts as deployments running on their individual workstations.  An open source app may have hundreds or thousands of deployments.

Although all running the same code, each of these deploys have environment-specific configurations.  One example would be credentials for an external service, such as Amazon S3.  Developers may share one S3 account, while the staging site and production sites each have their own keys.

The traditional approach for handling such config vars is to put them under source. Often in a YAML file, such as `config/s3.yml`.  This is a slightly error-prone process, and is especially complicated for an open source app, which probably has to maintain a separate (and private) branch with the app-specific configurations.

A better solution is to use environment variables, and keep the keys out of the code.  On a traditional host or working locally you can set environment vars in your `bashrc`.  On Heroku, you use config vars.

Quick example
-------------

Add some config vars for your S3 account keys:

    :::term
    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku config:add S3_KEY=8N029N81 S3_SECRET=9s83109d3+583493190
    Adding config vars:
      S3_KEY    => 8N029N81
      S3_SECRET => 9s83109d3+583493190
    Restarting app...done.

Set up your code to read the vars at runtime in `config/initializers/s3.rb`:

    :::ruby
    AWS::S3::Base.establish_connection!(
      :access_key_id     => ENV['S3_KEY'],
      :secret_access_key => ENV['S3_SECRET']
    )

Now, upon deploying to Heroku, the app will use the keys set in the config.

NOTE: Environment variables set with heroku config are persistent. They will remain in place across deploys and app restarts, so unless you need to change values you only need to set them once.  

Local setup
-----------

In the example shown above, the app would run with the AWS keys set to `nil` on a developer workstation or any host other than Heroku.  You can set these values in the `~/.bashrc` for the user:

    export S3_KEY=mykey
    export S3_SECRET=mysecret

Or, specify them when running the local server (or any other command, like a rake task) by prepending the shell command:

    :::term
    $ S3_KEY=mykey S3_SECRET=mysecret script/server

Another option is to have default values when running locally:

    :::ruby
    AWS::S3::Base.establish_connection!(
      :access_key_id     => ENV['S3_KEY'] || 'thedefaultkey',
      :secret_access_key => ENV['S3_SECRET'] || 'thedefaultsecret'
    )

(This pattern is identical to that used for the [DATABASE_URL](/rack#using-datamapper-or-sequel) defaults.)

You might fill in the S3 account allocated for developers to fool around with as the default, and override this with the production keys on the production site.

Config commands
---------------

Use `heroku config`, `config:add`, `config:remove`, and `config:clear` to manage your config vars.

    :::term
    $ heroku config:add GITHUB_USERNAME=joesmith
    Adding config vars:
      GITHUB_USERNAME => joesmith
    Restarting app...done.
    
    $ heroku config
    GITHUB_USERNAME => joesmith
    RACK_ENV => production
    
    $ heroku config:clear
    Clearing all config vars and restarting app...done.

Long Config Vars
-----------------------

`heroku config` will truncate long config var names on display.  This is for security and brevity:

    :::term
    $ heroku config
    NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY => da412123...ea6aa145d
    
To see the full value of your configuration variables, use the --long argument:

    :::term
    $ heroku config --long
    NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY => YOURLONGSTRINGWITHOUTTRUNCATION
    
RACK_ENV, RAILS_ENV, MERB_ENV
-----------------------------

The RACK_ENV value is set to production by default.  You should rarely, if ever, want to change this.  But you can set it the same as any other config value if you so desire:

    :::term
    $ heroku config:add RACK_ENV=staging
    Adding config vars:
      RACK_ENV => staging
    Restarting app...done.

Note: RAILS_ENV and MERB_ENV will automatically mirror whatever is in RACK_ENV.  Don't set RAILS_ENV or MERB_ENV directly.

Note: It is not recommended that you ever set your RACK_ENV=development, as that will enable reloading and slow down your app's dyno significantly.
