RhoConnect Service 
==========

RhoConnect is a data synchronization server and client library which keeps enterprise app data current and available on users’ smartphones. 

The information is stored locally on a user’s device and available even when disconnected and offline.  

Full documentation of all capabilities of RhoConnect is in the [RhoConnect Developer Reference](http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhosync/introduction).

Gem
-----
To install the latest stable RhoConnect gem, run:

	:::term
	$ [sudo] gem install rhoconnect

Using from Rails
------------
To use rhoconnect from a rails application you must first install the `rhoconnect-rb` gem.

	:::term
	$ [sudo] gem install rhoconnect-rb
	
**NOTE: rhoconnect-rb only supports rails 3.  You will not be able to connect your app to rhoconnect with rails < 3.**

Load the `rhoconnect-rb` library

	:::ruby
	require 'rhoconnect-rb'
	
**NOTE: If you are using datamapper, install the `dm-seriarlizer` library and require it in your application.  rhoconnect-rb depends on this utility to interact with Rhoconnect applications using JSON.**

You will have to let your rails app know where your rhoconnect instance is located.  From inside your `environment.rb` file you can define:
	
	:::ruby
	ENV['RHOCONNECT_URL'] = 'http://token@rhoservice.heroku.com'
	
**NOTE: when provisioning rhoconnect from heroku, a rhoconnect url and token will be returned to you.**

Next you will need to include Rhoconnect::Resource in the model you want to synchronize with your mobile application:

	:::ruby
	class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
	  include Rhosync::Resource
	end

Or, if you are using DataMapper:

	:::ruby
	class Product
	  include DataMapper::Resource
	  include Rhosync::Resource
	end
	
Your model will also have to declare a partition key for rhoconnect-rb.  This partition key is used by rhoconnect-rb to uniquely identify the model dataset when it is stored in a RhoConnect application.
It is typically an attribute on the model or related model.  rhoconnect-rb supports two types of partitions:

* app - No unique key will be used, a shared dataset is used for all users
* lambda{some lambda} - Execute a lambda which returns the unique key string
	
For example, the Product model above might have a belongs_to :user relationship.  The partition identifying the username would be declared as:
	:::ruby
	class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
	  include Rhosync::Resource

	  belongs_to :user

	  partition lambda { self.user.username }
	end
	




Deploying to Heroku
-----------------------
To use RhoConnect from Heroku, install the RhoConnect add-on:

	:::term
	$ heroku addons:add rhoconnect
	
Setup
-----
From inside your heroku account you will need to setup the url to your backend service that RhoConnect will connect to.

Click the addons drop down and select rhoconnect.

Once redirected to the admin console of your rhoconnect instance, you will need to set the adapter url to your backend service.  Select Adapter Url from the right menu.

From here you can enter a url to your backend service.  Enter a url ex: http://myrailsapp.com, and click add to save the url.

Rhoconnect is now setup with your backend service.  You are now ready to create a rhodes app using the [Rhodes framework](http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhodes/tutorial) or synchronize existing clients using [rhoconnect.js](https://github.com/rhomobile/rhoconnect.js)
