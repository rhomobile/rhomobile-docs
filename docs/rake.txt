Running rake commands
=====================

Rake tasks are executed on Heroku's dyno grid, within the same environment as
your app's [dynos](/dynos). You can run rake tasks within the remote app
environment using the `heroku rake` command as follows:

    $ heroku rake db:version
    (in /home/slugs/41913_06f36ef_ab3a/mnt)
    Current version: 20081118092504

You can pass rake arguments, run multiple tasks, and pass environment variables
just as you would locally. For instance, to migrate the database to a specific
version with verbose backtraces:

    $ heroku rake --trace db:migrate VERSION=20081118092504

### Limitations

Not all Rake features are supported on Heroku. The following is
a list of known limitations:

 * Rake tasks that write to disk, such as `rake db:schema:dump`, are not
   compatible with Heroku's read-only filesystem. In most cases, an equivalent
   heroku command is available. See the [importing / exporting database](/taps)
   topic for an alternative to `db:schema:dump`.

 * Multiple `heroku rake` invocations may run on different machines, so
   you shouldn't assume that data written to temporary storage in one rake
   invocation will be available to subsequent invocations.

 * The `rake db:reset` task is not supported. Heroku apps do not have
   permission to drop and create databases. Use the `heroku db:reset` command
   instead.

 * Rake tasks cannot read from `stdin`. Piping data to `heroku rake` or
   prompting for user input is not supported.

See the [application constraints](/constraints) topic for additional information
and potential workarounds.
