===

This client includes built-in support for [SenchaTouch](http://www.sencha.com/) data API and [Persistence.js](http://persistencejs.org/) models.

Rhoconnect.js is completely UI-agnostic framework, so feel free to use any type of UI javascript library.

Due to to the CORS support in [RhoConnect](http://rhomobile.com/products/rhoconnect) server, you are able to create cross-domain applications and standalone mobile applications using [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/) framework.
