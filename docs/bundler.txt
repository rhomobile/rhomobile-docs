Gem Bundler
===========

Gem Bundler is the default gem manager for Rails 3, and can be used with any Ruby project as it has no dependency on framework.  

NOTE: Bundler can only be used on the Bamboo stack.  Using Bundler with the Aspen stack will not work.

Current Bundler Version
---------------
1.0.0

Bundler is evolving quickly.  Heroku will try to stay as up-to-date as possible as Bundler releases new versions.  As this is experimental support, it is your responsibility to make sure you stay compatible with the latest version of Bundler.  Announcements of new versions will be posted to the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/heroku/).

Using Bundler
-------------

To use, install bundler:

    :::term
    $ gem install bundler

Create a file named Gemfile in the root of your app specifying what gems are required to run it:

    :::ruby
    source :gemcutter
    gem 'sinatra', '1.0'

The Gemfile should be added to the git repository since it is part of the app. You should also add the .bundle directory to your gitignore file.  Once you have added the Gemfile, it makes it easy for other developers to get their environment ready to run the app:

    :::term
    $ bundle install

This will ensure all gems specified on Gemfile, together with their dependencies, are available for your application.  Running "bundle install" will also generate a "Gemfile.lock" file.  We encourage you to add the Gemfile.lock file to your git repo.  The Gemfile.lock ensures that your deployed versions of gems on Heroku match the version installed locally on your development machine.

Heroku also uses that file to resolve and install your application dependencies automatically. All you need to do is to push it:

    :::term
    -----> Heroku receiving push
    -----> Sinatra app detected
    -----> Gemfile detected, running Bundler version 1.0.0
           Unresolved dependencies detected; Installing...
           Using rack (1.2.1) 
           Using sinatra (1.0) 
           Using bundler (1.0.0) 
           Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.

           Your bundle was installed to `.bundle/gems`
           Compiled slug size is 10.7MB
    -----> Launching.... done



Specifying gems & groups
------------------------

The recommended use of gem bundler is to bundle absolutely every gem your app depends upon.  This includes your framework (Rails, Sinatra, etc) and your database connectors. 

Bundling Rails and other dependencies does increase your slug size by a few megabytes.  Increased slug size is a worthwhile tradeoff for vastly simplified dependency management, as well as the flexibility of being able to use any version of Rails you wish.

Heroku does not specify any groups during bundle installation, so all gems from all groups will be bundled with your application.  We are working with the bundler team to implement a way to restrict groups on deploy as part of Bundler 1.1.

Using Bundler from Rails 3
--------------------------

Rails 3 is built on top of Bundler. That means there is no setup needed, all gems specified on the Gemfile are ready for use on your app.
    
Using Bundler from Rails 2.3.X
------------------------------

Follow the instructions [here](http://gembundler.com/rails23.html).  Remember to remove all your "config.gem" lines from your environment configuration file!  Also remember to specify the your database gem as appropriate.

    :::term
    gem "pg", :group => :production
    gem "sqlite3-ruby", :group => :development
    
After you have added the code to your application, run

    :::term
    $ bundle install
    
And your app should now be using Gembundler.

Using Bundler from Sinatra or any Rack app
------------------------------------------

Gembundler has a great set of [documentation](http://gembundler.com/sinatra.html) on how to use bundler with Sinatra and other frameworks as well.
