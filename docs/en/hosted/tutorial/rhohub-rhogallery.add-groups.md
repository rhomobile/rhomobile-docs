# Adding Groups
Sometimes, you'll want to invite entire groups of people to a gallery to download that gallery's apps. For example if you had a specific set of apps that you want all your delivery drivers to have, you would add all the drivers to a group and invite the whole group to that gallery instead of inviting each person separately.

There are again, two ways to accomplish this:

1. [From the Gallery](#from-the-gallery) - You can create a new group or add an existing group to your gallery from within the gallery.
2. ["My Groups" List](#from-the-ldquomy-groupsrdquo-list) - You can add a new group to your list of groups, then add that group as an existing group, to any of your galleries.

## From the Gallery

As you can see here, you can add multiple groups at a time.</p>

## Group Invitation Message
When you invite a group to a gallery, the invitation message will be sent to each individual in the group and will look exactly like the [consumer invitation message](../add-consumers/rhohub-rhogallery#rhogallery-message).
