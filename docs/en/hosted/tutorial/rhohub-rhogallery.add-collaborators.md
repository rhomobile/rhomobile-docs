		<p>You have now added this user as a collaborator on your gallery. Doing this means that they have the rights to add or remove consumers, groups, and apps to / from your gallery. On the collaborator's side, they will see this gallery in their list of galleries but, the name of the gallery will be pre-pended by your RhoMobile account username.</p>
