# Adding Consumers
In addition to a gallery of apps, you also need consumers for your app. Consumers can use the RhoGallery mobile app to receive your apps from your RhoMobile gallery, and install those apps on their mobile device.

There are two methods you can use to invite consumers:

1. [From the Gallery](#from-the-gallery) - This method is the most straight forward as it automatically adds the consumer to the gallery from which you invite them.
2. ["My Consumers" List](#ldquomy-consumersrdquo-list) - This method adds the consumer to a list of consumers but you must manually add them to the gallery(ies) afterward.

## From the Gallery

## RhoGallery Message
The consumer will receive an email, an SMS message, or both, similar to the following. The email version of this message will have the subject "Your &lt;gallery_name&gt; Gallery Invitation is Here". When the invited consumer clicks this link, they will be directed to a site where they can download the apps you have placed in the gallery that they are invited to.

	:::term
	You are invited to My Gallery gallery. 

	Please accept this invitation to my RhoMobile app gallery. 

	This is a notification from RhoGallery.
