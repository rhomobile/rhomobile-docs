# RhoHub Gallery and RhoGallery Tutorial

RhoHub gallery administrators can invite mobile device owners to connect to their RhoHub gallery. You use the RhoGallery app on your mobile device to connect to that RhoHub gallery. Then you can install the apps in that RhoHub gallery onto your mobile device, and run those apps.

## Installing RhoGallery on a Mobile Device

A mobile device must have the RhoGallery application installed in order to sync with a gallery on RhoHub. To install the RhoGallery application, open your device's web browser, go to http://bit.ly/getrho, and install the RhoGallery app.

## Connecting to a RhoHub Gallery from Your Mobile Device

When you open the RhoGallery app on your mobile device, you enter the name of the RhoHub gallery to which you wish to connect, and your username and password.

## Installing Apps from a RhoHub Gallery onto Your Mobile Device

Once you have connected to a RhoHub gallery from your mobile device, you can install applications from that gallery onto your mobile device and run them. Here is an example of a mobile device logged into a RhoHub gallery, and a list of applications in that gallery. (This is under the Galleries tab in RHoGallery.)

To install any of those applications on your mobile device, click the Install button for that application. For example, if the RhoHub account has the external app Toshl, you can click its Install button in the RhoGallery apps list.

You will be asked if you want to install the application. Click the Install button.
