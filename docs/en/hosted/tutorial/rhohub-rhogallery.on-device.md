# RhoGallery Mobile
When you invite someone to One of your RhoGalleries, they will receive a link that will direct them to a page where they can download your specific build(s) of the RhoGallery mobile app. If you do not choose to customize your own RhogGallery mobile app, you can use the default builds that are available for each platform.

## Customization
Customization in the latest version of RhoGallery is very different than it used to be. If you would like to customize the look and feel of your RhoGallery mobile app, fork our repository of the app [here](https://github.com/rhomobile/rhogallery-mobile) and check out the section of the README.md on [customization](https://github.com/rhomobile/rhogallery-mobile#customizing). Once you have forked the repo, you can customize the app and then build it using the [instructions in the README](https://github.com/rhomobile/rhogallery-mobile#building) and then upload your build to your RhoGallery account on rhomobile.com. Once you have added the build there, consumers you invite will be able to download the custom version onto their devices.

## Default RhoGallery Mobile App
NOTE: For demonstration purposes I'll be using the Android version of the RhoGallery mobile app.

		<p>The default look and feel of the RhoGallery mobile app is quite plain but it definitely gets the job of distributing your apps through your galleries done. As you can see here, I am a member of one organization, "mtoews" which is the organization that invited me to use RhoGallery.</p>
