## RhoStudio
A powerful Eclipse plug-in that allows you to develop, test and debug your RhoMobile applications. Runs on both a Windows PC or Mac and includes RhoSimulator, a device and platform simulator customized for your RhoMobile application development.

## RhoMobile
RhoMobile is the mobile application container that runs as a true native application but allows you to easily write cross platform code by using common web skills. In addition to supporting standard web languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Ruby, RhoMobile provides device, system and framework access through it's Rhodes and RhoElements API libraries. RhoMobile applications come with a RhoConnect client for easy integration with a RhoConnect application to provide data synchronization.

### Rhodes
Rhodes is a API library set that is accessible to all RhoMobile applications. It provides access via both JavaScript and Ruby interfaces and allows developers to access device level capabilities like Camera or geolocation. Rhodes is free to use, open-source and developers can contribute to the project.

### RhoElements
RhoElements is an additional API library set that is accessible to RhoMobile applications and is optimized and customized to run on Zebra Technologies devices. It provides access via both JavaScript and Ruby programming languages and allows developers access to an extended set of device capabilities like Bar Code Scanning and hardware capabilities that are only provided on enterprise level mobile devices. RhoElements also provides a modern Webkit to Windows Mobile/CE platforms. 

## RhoConnect
RhoConnect is a server application that either can be hosted on our system or yours and acts as a seamless bridge for your enterprise data to exist both on your back-end and your mobile device. With RhoConnect, you can simultaneously connect your application to many data sources just as easily as you can connect to one data source — including enterprise back-end customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, web services, databases and much more.
