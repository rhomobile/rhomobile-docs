RhoHub Gallery and RhoGallery Tutorial
========

For your RhoGallery users to access your custom landing pages, you must build and publish them. You publish your custom landing pages under Build and Publish. Click the Build button to build your custom landing page for your desired device type. Then click Publish to publish the landing page. You must have published one or more app builds for the respective device type in order to publish the custom landing page.

## Landing Page

Under Landing Page, select which landing page is sent to your consumers. You can still use the standard RhoHub page, or you can link to your customized RhoGallery Mobile landing page, which contain the customizations that you have done in RhoGallery Mobile. This link will only display the pages that you have built and published.

When your consumers navigate on their mobile device to the link provided for your custom landing pages, they will see a list where they can download the RhoGallery app that uses your published and built custom landing pages.
