# Install RhoElements

## Windows

If you're running Windows, download the latest Motorola RhoMobile Suite for Windows. This installs the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction), [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction), and [RhoElements](/rhoelements/introduction).

If you are running Windows 64-bit, you need to use 32-bit Java when you run RhoStudio. You can include the 32-bit Java in the PATH, or you can run RhoStudio with a link to 32-bit Java:

	C:\RhoStudio\eclipse\RhoStudio.exe -vm "<32-bit java path>\bin\javaw.exe"

Once you install Motorola RhoMobile Suite on Windows, you will see Motorola RhoMobile Suite on the Windows Start menu with the following options:

* A link to the [developer community](http://developer.motorolasolutions.com).
* A link to the [RhoMobile documentation](/home).
* A launcher for RhoStudio.
* A link to the readme file.
* A link to the RhoElements Runtime files. You use these when you create a [RhoElements hybrid application](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-webapps), or when you create a [RhoElements native application](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-native) in shared mode.
* An uninstaller for RhoMobile Suite.

## Mac OS

If you're running Mac OS, download the latest Motorola RhoMobile Suite for Macintosh. This contains the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction), [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction), and [RhoElements](/rhoelements/introduction).

Click on the RhoInstaller for Mac download file to open it. You will get a window similar to this:

Run the install gems script appropriate for you. You can run "Install gems." If you have Ruby Version Manager, you can run "Install gems on rvm." A terminal window will open; wait for the gems install process to complete.

Then drag RhoStudio to the Applications folder.

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for Motorola RhoMobile Suite. If you are planning to build for Android, make sure you have JDK version 1.6.0_2 or higher installed.

### Installing the Java Development Kit

The Sun JDK for Windows or Linux is available [here](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp). For Windows, install the 32-bit version of the JDK; RhoStudio needs the 32-bit version.

For Mac OS 10.6 and earlier, the JDK is already installed. For Mac OS 10.7, Java is not automatically installed. Download the Java for Mac Installer from [Apple support](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421) and install Java.

### Setting the JDK Path

On Windows installs for RhoMobile, go to RhoStudio Preferences (Windows -> Preferences) and set the JDK path in the rhobuild.yml file. 

**NOTE: On Windows 64-bit installations, you must set this path to the 32-bit version of the JDK, such as `C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.7.0_01/bin`.**

On Mac OS, the path to the JDK is automatically set once Java is installed.
