# Motorola API

## Barcode for Motorola devices
Rhodes 3.3 and RhoElements 2.0 support barcode for Motorola devices. Install RhoElements gem or RhoStudio and start developing for Motorola Windows Mobile, Windows CE and Android(ET1) devices .

### Android prerequisites:
In order to enable motorola barcode scanning feature on Android (ET1) you need to install Motorola SDK add-on to Android SDK. Please contact RhoMobile support for more details.

### Windows CE prerequisites:
In order to enable motorola barcode scanning feature on Windows CE you need to install Motorola EMDK library.

    link to EMDK update - https://docs.symbol.com/downloads/EMDK-C-020004-Up2.zip   

### Build
To enable add to build.yml:

    capabilities:
    -motorola

    extensions: ["barcode-moto"]

### Barcode API

Get a list of scanners present on the device. Return array of hashes ('name','id'):

	:::ruby
    Barcode.enumerate 
    
Enables the scanner. barcode_callback get the same parameters as Barcode.take_barcode:

    :::ruby
    Barcode.enable(url_for(:action => :barcode_callback), {:id=>id_from_enumerate})

Callback parameters:

* "status" - "ok" or "cancel"
* "barcode" - recognized barcode string

Disables the currently enabled scanner. This reverts the scanner to its default state and flushes any current decoder settings

    :::ruby    
    Barcode.disable

Performs a soft trigger start. If the scan does not result in a decode it is necessary to perform a soft stop before another soft start    

    :::ruby    
    Barcode.start

Performs a soft trigger stop     

    :::ruby    
    Barcode.stop 

Enables the scanner and start scanner. Before callback is called scanner is disabled:

    :::ruby
    Barcode.take_barcode(url_for(:action => :barcode_callback), {:id=>id_from_enumerate})

THe callback uses these parameters.

 * "status" - "ok" or "cancel"
 * "barcode" - recognized barcode string

### Sample
See controller and view in the /app/BarcodeRecognizerMoto folder of the [System API Samples application](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes-system-api-samples/tree/master/app/BarcodeRecognizerMoto/controller.rb) for more information.

## WebKit browser for Motorola devices
Rhodes 3.3 and RhoElements 2.0 support Motorola WebKit browser for Windows Mobile, Windows CE and Android (ET1) devices.

To enable: install RhoElements gem or RhoStudio and add to build.yml

    capabilities:
    -motorola

    extensions: ["webkit-browser"]

## RhoElements Shared Runtime

### Building RhoElements Shared Runtime

1. Install RhoStudio with RhoElements using latest version of RhoInstaller.

2. Make sure you have installed all [prerequisites for Windows Mobile platform](/rhodes/build#build-for-windows-mobile).

3. To build the `cab` file of RhoElements Shared Runtime:

       :::term
       $ cd <RhoStudio>\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\rhoelements-2.0.0
       $ rake build:rhoelements:runtime

The resulting `cab` file can be found at `<RhoStudio>\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\rhoelements-2.0.0\RhoElements2\bin\target\<platform_id>\RhoElements2.cab`.

### Installing RhoElements Shared Runtime
Install `RhoElements2.cab` to the device the usual way or install it directly to the connected device from command line:

    :::term
    $ cd <RhoStudio>\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\rhoelements-2.0.0\RhoElements2
    $ rake run:wm:device:cab

NOTE: RhoElements Shared Runtime <b>must</b> be installed to the primary disk partition of Windows CE/Mobile device, i.e. it has to be installed to `\Program Files\RhoElements2` only.
On Windows Mobile the `Device` option must be selected when the installer asks for the location to install.
On Windows CE the default path (`\Program Files\RhoElements2`) must be selected.

### Install and run RhoElements v2.0 applications
To build RhoElements v2.0 application with use of RhoElements Shared Runtime add `use_re_runtime` parameter to the `wm` section of `build.yml` file
located at application root folder, it should look like this:

    wm:
      use_re_runtime: yes

To build the `cab` file issue the command at the application root folder:

    :::term
    $ rake device:wm:production

The resulting `cab` file can be found at `bin\target\<platform_id>` folder of the application.

To install and run application on the connected device issue the command at the application root folder:

    :::term
    $ rake run:wm:device:cab

NOTE: RhoElements v2.0 applications <b>must</b> be installed to the primary disk partition of Windows CE/Mobile device, i.e. they have to be installed to `\Program Files\&lt;app-name&gt;` only.
On Windows Mobile the `Device` option must be selected when the installer asks for the location to install.
On Windows CE the default path (`\Program Files\&lt;app-name&gt;`) must be selected.

### RhoElements Shared Runtime command line parameters
RhoElements v2.0 applications should be deployed and ran as described above.
RhoElements v1.0 applications should be started using command line parameters.

The runtime installation path on Windows CE/Mobile devices is `\Program Files\RhoElements2` and the path to the executable is `\Program Files\RhoElements2\RhoElements2.exe`.

The following command line parameters are supported by the RhoElements Shared Runtime (`RhoElements2.exe`):

    /C: Specifies the location of the configuration file for
        RhoElements v1.0 application
        e.g. /C:file://\application\config.xml
    /S: Specifies the start page of the RhoElements v1.0 application
        e.g. /S:file://\HTML\index.html
        e.g. /S:http://www.motorola.com
    -approot='<path-to-app>': Specifies the path to the root folder
        of the RhoElements v2.0 application
        e.g. -approot='\Program Files\app'

If `/C` parameter is present with no `/S` parameter, then the value from `Configuration` > `Applications` > `Application` > `General` > `StartPage` tag
of the configuration file will be used as the start page parameter.

If `/S` parameter is present with no `/C` parameter, then the default configuration file from the runtime will be used to launch the application.

If neither `/S` nor `/C` nor `-approot` parameters are present, then the default empty RhoElements application will be started.
