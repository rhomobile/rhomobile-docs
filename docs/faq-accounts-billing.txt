Accounts and Billing
====================

How do you prorate charges?
---------------------------
Dynos & Workers are prorated per second at a rate of $0.05/hr.  Dynos and workers are charged based on the number you have set, regardless of the amount of activity they are receiving.

Databases are prorated per hour, based on their applicable monthly fee.  

All add-ons are prorated per second, unless explicitly noted otherwise.

How do I delete my account?
---------------------------

To delete your account, [submit a support ticket](http://support.heroku.com/tickets/new) or email support@heroku.com. In either case, it's important that you originate your request from the Heroku account email address on record, either by logging in as that user or emailing from this address.


How do I change my email address?
---------------------------

To change your email address, [submit a support ticket](http://support.heroku.com/tickets/new) or email support@heroku.com. In either case, it's important that you originate your request from the Heroku account email address on record, either by logging in as that user or emailing from this address.

Why do I have to provide my billing details to use add-ons?
---------------------------

Some features, most notably outgoing email and custom domains, carry a potential for abuse. As a business, we need to be able reliably identify and contact our users in the event of an issue. We have found that a credit card on file provides the most reliable way of obtaining verified contact information.

I don't have a credit card. Can I still verify?
-----------------------------------------------

Currently, you need a credit card to verify. We continue to research other means of verification, and will announce if other methods are made available.

Do you accept foreign credit cards?
-----------------------------------

Yes, a standard VISA, Mastercard or American Express should work regardless of issuing country. If your card doesn't work, please [submit a support ticket](http://support.heroku.com/tickets/new) or email support@heroku.com.
