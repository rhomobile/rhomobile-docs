## Setup

This tutorial assumes that you have an account on RhoHub, and that you have an application(s) in it. If you have not set up a RhoHub account, see [Pre-requisite Reading]().

## Understanding RhoHub Galleries and RhoGallery

Frameworks such as Rhodes make it easy for developers to build native apps for all smartphones. However, developers need to get those apps to user's devices so users can test them. Enterprises with many mobile apps need to get the native apps out to all the enterprise users regardless of what kind of device the users have, need to manage who gets what apps, and need to update the apps for those users.

RhoGallery is a hosted app management solution. RhoGallery administrators can create galleries of apps, and they can invite consumers and groups of consumers to partake of those apps, and they can delete apps remotely. These apps can be Rhodes apps, or third party apps.

Note that the users of RhoGallery -- who install the RhoHub Gallery apps onto their mobile device using the RhoGallery mobile app -- are called consumers; this term of "consumers" is targeted at enterprise workers, to distinguish them from the RhoHub Gallery administrators.

The consumers receive an invite to a RhoGallery via SMS or email. The consumers then launch the RhoGallery app on their mobile device, and it will contain all the apps on RhoGallery for their company and job. And they will be able to organize and launch their enterprise apps from RhoGallery.

## Adding a RhoHub Gallery

Before you can send your applications to consumers, you need to have a RhoHub gallery for your applications and consumers.

In your RhoHub account, click on the Galleries tab.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/galleries-tab.jpg"/>

If needed, click on Galleries to show the Galleries section. In the Galleries section, click the Create Galleries button.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/gallery-button.jpg"/>

In the Add new Gallery pop-up window, enter a name for the gallery. Optionally, you can enter a description for your gallery, and choose an icon for that gallery. Click Create Gallery.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-new-gallery.jpg"/>

## Adding Applications to (and Managing) Your RhoHub Gallery

Now you need to add apps to your gallery. Click the Add a new App button.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-new-app-button.jpg"/>

### Step 1: Manage Your App

In the Add new app pop-up window, enter the name you want for your app. You can add an optional description and an optional icon to your app (the icon defaults to a Rhodes logo). Click Next.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-new-app-step1.jpg"/>

### Step 2: Device Target

Select the Device type (Android, iOS, Blackberry, Windows Mobile), enter the following:

 * A version number for your app. This number is displayed on the app in RhoGallery on the mobile device.
 * The app ID. For example, for an Android app named fieldservice, you might use com.rhomobile.fieldservice. Enter the app ID in the format for your platform, and unique for your app.
 * A security token. You enter this if you are adding a Rhodes app and you used a security_token setting in your build.yml; the app will only launch if that security token is entered.
 * OS version: the OS version. Only enter this for Blackberry.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-new-app-step2.jpg"/>

### Step 3: Select the Build Type

In Step 3: Select Builds, select the type of build. (The pop-up window title changes to Upload Build Sources.)

#### RhoHub Build

For RhoHub Build, select a RhoHub build for a Rhodes application in your RhoHub account. Click Next.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-new-app-step3-RhoHub.jpg"/>

#### Local Build

For Local Build, click the Select Files button, then navigate to and select the files for your application on your local computer to be uploaded to your RhoHub gallery. 

 * Windows Mobile: .cab file.
 * BlackBerry: .jad file and all .cod files.
 * Android: Signed .apk file. 
 * iPhone: .plist file and .ipa file.

This application does not have to be Rhodes-built: it can be any app that you have created on your computer. However, the app type must match the Device type that you selected in Step 2: Device Target.

For an iPhone app on a local build, you need to create a .plist file that you will upload to your RhoHub gallery. Use this sample [iPhone plist](https://gist.github.com/826832) as a template.

This .plist file has its base URL set to example.com. That is required for RhoHub local builds.

Edit this .plist file to point to your iOS application (.ipa) file: edit this line, replacing MyApp.ipa with the name of your .ipa file.

	:::term
	<string>http://example.com/MyApp.ipa</string>

Edit the .plist so its image URLs point to your image files: edit lines like this, replacing the image names with the names of your image files.

	:::term
	<string>http://example.com/icon512.png</string>

Edit the .plist file so that its bundle-identifier matches the app ID that you entered in step 2, and its bundle-version matches the version number that you entered in step 2. Look for this section in the .plist file and replace com.acme.rhodesapp and 1.0 with your app ID and version number.

	:::term
	<key>bundle-identifier</key>
	<string>com.acme.rhodesapp</string>
	<key>bundle-version</key>
	<string>1.0</string>

After you have selected the .plist file and the .ipa file, click Next.

#### Remote Build

For Remote Build, enter the link to the application file.

 * Windows Mobile, .cab file.
 * BlackBerry, .jad file.
 * Android, .apk file.
 * iPhone: .plist file. 

This example shows a link to an Android build on toshl.com, a third party expense tracking application.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-new-app-step3-remote.jpg"/>

Click Next.

### Step 4: Review

In Review, click Finish.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-new-app-review.jpg"/>

You now have an app in your RhoHub gallery. Here is an example of a gallery with a RhoHub app and a remote app.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/rhohub-gallery-apps.jpg"/>

## Adding Consumers to Your RhoHub Gallery

You also need consumers for your app. Consumers can use the RhoGallery mobile app to receive your app from your RhoHub gallery, and install it on their mobile device.

From your gallery, click the Invite button.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/rhohub-gallery-invite-button.jpg"/>

In the Invite Consumers pop-up window, enter a login name for your consumer, your consumer's name, and check the checkboxes to notify the consumer via email, or SMS, or both. Enter your consumer's email address if you notify by email; enter your consumer's cell phone number if you notify by SMS. You can also enter groups you want your consumer to be in; if the group does not exist yet, this will create the group.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/invite-consumers.jpg"/>

You will see the consumer added to your gallery.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/gallery-consumers-added.jpg"/>

The consumer will receive an email, or an SMS, or both, similar to the following:

	:::term
	You are invited to dave-gal on RhoHub.
	Install RhoGallery: http://bit.ly/getrho
	RhoHub Account: davidstrom
	Username: david
	Password: temporary-password
	
	Thanks, RhoHub Support

Consumers will enter the RhoHub account name, the Username, and the Password into the RhoGallery app on their mobile device to join your RhoHub gallery. This is discussed later in this tutorial.

## Adding Groups to Your RhoHub Gallery

You can create groups and add consumers to those groups. For example, you may wish to have a group for sales consumers, and another group for engineers. Also, you can add these groups to other galleries. For example, if you create a new gallery, you can add the sales group from your original gallery to your new gallery.

To create a group, go to the Consumers section in your gallery by clicking on Consumers.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/consumers-button-section.jpg"/>

In the Consumers section, click the Create Group button.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/create-group-button.jpg"/>

In the Add new Group pop-up window, enter the name for your group, then click Create Group.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-new-group.jpg"/>

Now you can add consumers to the group. Click on Add Consumer.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/Add-Consumer.jpg"/>

In the Add Consumers pop-up window, under the New Consumers tab, you can add a new consumer to your group by entering a login name and consumer name, and entering your consumer's email address to notify by email, or cell phone number if you notify by SMS. (This is the same process you would use when you add a consumer from the Gallery section.) Then click Invite.

Under the Existing Consumer tab, you see a list of consumers whom you have added to your gallery. To add these consumers to your group, check the checkbox for those consumers. Then click Invite. 

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/add-consumer-existing.jpg"/>

Those consumers are added to the group.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/consumers-group.jpg"/>

Now add the group to your gallery. In the Galleries section, click on the Invite button, as you did when you invited consumers to the gallery.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/rhohub-gallery-invite-button2.png"/>

In the Invite Consumers pop-up window, click the Existing Consumers tab. Then check the checkbox for the group that you are adding to your gallery. Then click the Invite button, then Close.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/invite-group.jpg"/>

The group is now added to your gallery.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/galleries-group-added.jpg"/>

## Managing Collaborators

You can add collaborators. Collaborators are other people who have RhoHub accounts who can work with you on this gallery. To add a collaborator, in the Galleries section, click on Manage Collaborators.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/manage-collaborators-link.jpg"/>

In the Manage Collaborators pop-up window, enter the RhoHub user name, then click the Add Collaborator button.

## Customizing The RhoGallery Look and Feel from RhoHub

### Build and Publish

For your RhoGallery users to access your custom landing pages, you must build and publish them. You publish your custom landing pages under Build and Publish. Click the Build button to build your custom landing page for your desired device type. Then click Publish to publish the landing page. You must have published one or more app builds for the respective device type in order to publish the custom landing page.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/build-and-publish.png"/>

### Landing Page

Under Landing Page, select which landing page is sent to your consumers. You can still use the standard RhoHub page, or you can link to your customized RhoGallery Mobile landing page, which contain the customizations that you have done in RhoGallery Mobile. This link will only display the pages that you have built and published.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/rhohub-mobile-look-feel-landing-page.jpg"/>

When your consumers navigate on their mobile device to the link provided for your custom landing pages, they will see a list where they can download the RhoGallery app that uses your published and built custom landing pages.

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/RhoGallery-landing-page.png"/>

## Using RhoGallery to Get RhoHub Gallery Apps onto Your Mobile Device

RhoHub gallery administrators can invite mobile device owners to connect to their RhoHub gallery. You use the RhoGallery app on your mobile device to connect to that RhoHub gallery. Then you can install the apps in that RhoHub gallery onto your mobile device, and run those apps.

### Installing RhoGallery on a Mobile Device

A mobile device must have the RhoGallery application installed in order to sync with a gallery on RhoHub. To install the RhoGallery application, open your device's web browser, go to http://bit.ly/getrho, and install the RhoGallery app.

### Connecting to a RhoHub Gallery from Your Mobile Device

When you open the RhoGallery app on your mobile device, you enter the name of the RhoHub gallery to which you wish to connect, and your username and password. 

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/rhogallery-login.jpg"/>

You received this information in the email and/or SMS that was sent when the RHoHub gallery administrator invited you to join that RhoHub gallery.

	:::term
	You are invited to dave-gal on RhoHub.
	Install RhoGallery: http://bit.ly/getrho
	RhoHub Account: davidstrom
	Username: david
	Password: temporary-password
	
	Thanks, RhoHub Support

### Installing Apps from a RhoHub Gallery onto Your Mobile Device

Once you have connected to a RhoHub gallery from your mobile device, you can install applications from that gallery onto your mobile device and run them. Here is an example of a mobile device logged into a RhoHub gallery, and a list of applications in that gallery. (This is under the Galleries tab in RHoGallery.)

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhohub-rhogallery/rhogallery-myapps.jpg"/>

To install any of those applications on your mobile device, click the Install button for that application. For example, if the RhoHub account has the external app Toshl, you can click its Install button in the RhoGallery apps list.

You will be asked if you want to install the application. Click the Install button.
