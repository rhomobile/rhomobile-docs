Platform Stacks (Beta)
===============

Stacks overview
---------------

A stack is a complete deployment environment, including the base OS and all associated libraries.  Each stack runs on a different set of servers with different underlying operating systems, libraries, gems, and Ruby VMs available. Different stacks support different runtime environments.  

### Summary of stack and Ruby VM combinations:

<table id="stack-compare" class="compare">
  <tr>
    <th class="icon">&nbsp;</th><th class="tech">Base Technology</th><th>MRI 1.8.6</th><th>REE 1.8.7</th><th>MRI 1.9.1</th>
  </tr>
  <tr id="argent-aspen">
    <td class="icon"><a href="/aspen">Argent <strong>Aspen</strong></a></td>
		<td class="tech">Debian Etch 4.0</td>
		<td><span class="check">&bull;</span></td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="badious-bamboo">
    <td class="icon"><a href="/bamboo">Badious <strong>Bamboo</strong></a></td>
		<td class="tech">Debian Lenny 5.0</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td><span class="check">&bull;</span></td>
		<td><span class="check">&bull;</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Specify a stack by combining the stack name with the ruby VM name:

    <STACK_NAME>-<RUBY_VM_NAME>
    bamboo-ree-1.8.7
    
All apps are set to the "aspen-mri-1.8.6" stack by default.  You may migrate an app to a different stack at any time, or target a specific stack when creating your application.

You can see what stack your app is on, and all available stacks, using the heroku client (version 1.7 and higher):

    $ heroku stack
    * aspen-mri-1.8.6
      bamboo-ree-1.8.7
      bamboo-mri-1.9.1

Here, the app is running on [Argent Aspen](/aspen), using MRI 1.8.6.  [Badious Bamboo](/bamboo) stack is also available to this app, with two choices for the VM (Enterprise Edition 1.8.7 and MRI 1.9.1).

NOTE: Bamboo differs from Aspen in that there are no gems preinstalled by default.  Apps running on bamboo stack should package all of their gem dependencies into the slug using .gems or a Gemfile.

Targeting a stack on app creation
---------------------------------

When creating a new app, you may specify a stack during app creation:

    $ heroku create test-sushi-app --stack bamboo-ree-1.8.7
    Created http://test-sushi-app.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:test-sushi-app.git

This app is now automatically setup to use the bamboo stack.  Please read the notes on usage for individual stacks below.
    

Migrating between stacks
------------------------

You can begin migration to a new stack by using the stack:migrate command:

    $ heroku stack:migrate bamboo-ree-1.8.7
    ----> Preparing to migrate myapp from aspen-mri-1.8.6 to bamboo-ree-1.8.7

The migration will be completed after you git push and a new slug is successfully compiled.  The reason for this two-phase migration is so that you can see the output of your new slug compiling, in case anything should go wrong.  (If the slug fails to compile, your push will be rejected as normal and your existing app will continue to run.)

When migrating to a new stack, it's likely that the differences in the underlying runtime environment will result in some minor breakage in your app.  We highly recommend that you try pushing your app's code to a temporary Heroku app to test the migration process and the new environment, so that you can make any changes necessary to run on the new stack without affecting your production environment.  Once your code runs cleanly, you can push those changes back to your production app and do the migration.
