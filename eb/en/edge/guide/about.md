# About Enterprise Browser
## Welcome To the Enterprise Browser
Enterprise Browser is a powerful, next generation industrial browser enabling developers to build feature rich web applications that integrate seamlessly with the features in Motorola Solutions mobile computers and peripherals - such as barcode scanning, signature capture, printing and more. Enterprise Browser applications leverage standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript) to run and integrate with virtually any Motorola Solutions devices running Microsoft&copy; Windows Mobile, Windows&copy; CE or Android. With support for the legacy Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used in PocketBrowser and RhoElements Shared Runtime, Enterprise Browser is the ideal path forward for developers looking to migrate legacy applications to newer devices or to create applications with todays highly-graphical and intuitive user interfaces. Enterprise Browser features will speed up your application development time, reducing costs and making the transition to next generation devices and operating systems fast, easy and affordable - especially in high volume mobile environments.

##Key Features

###Enterprise Browser: An application development toolkit for mobile cross-platform enterprise apps
* Supports all enterprise devices: mobile computers, tablets, kiosks, wearables and vehicle mount
* Supports multiple operating systems: Windows&copy; Embedded Handheld, Windows&copy; CE, Windows&copy; Mobile and Android&copy;

###Build apps using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript
* Use web skills to create beautiful applications
* Based on open source and standard technologies, not proprietary toolkits
* Access the world's largest developer community

###Common APIs across all enterprise devices
* Single code base; does not require different APIs for different OSs to create a true write once, run anywhere experience
* Easily access device capabilities with JavaScript APIs

###Backward compatible with PocketBrowser
* Enterprise Browser is compatible with legacy PocketBrowser APIs, enabling a clear path forward for legacy applications
* EMML (Meta Tag) support extended to Android

###Backward compatible with RhoElements
* Enterprise Browser is compatible with legacy RhoElements JavaScript APIs enabling a clear path forward for "RhoElements Shared Runtime" users

###Unparalleled access to device capabilities
* Access all device features, including bar code scanning, signature capture, printing, RFID and much more.

###Thin client architecture
* Simplifies device deployment and management by enabling instant application updates on devices; ensures version consistency.

###Operating system "lock out"
* Hides access to distractions, such as web-browsing and games; simplifies user interface and eliminates risk of unauthorized changes to device settings.

###Full screen display
* Maximizes available display space for a richer, more effective user interface; hides command bar and Start menu

###Extensive logging capability
* Flexibility to easily capture logging information, reducing management and support effort

##Benefits

###Reduce application and development costs
Eliminates the need to develop, manage and maintain multiple versions of an application to support different types of devices/operating systems, providing highly cost effective support for a mixed-OS environment.

###Protect the business from OS market uncertainty
Devices and platforms can continue to churn without impacting your business - these OS-agnostic applications work on the Motorola Solutions platforms of yesterday (MPA2), today and tomorrow.

###Reduce end-user training costs
Enterprise Browser app development is incredibly intuitive for developers skilled in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

###Utilize every feature on every device - and attached peripheral
Easily design rich applications that take advantage of all the available features on a device and its attached peripherals - from scanning bar codes to capturing RFID tags and processing payment cards.

###Create consumer-style apps - for business
Without OS constraints to impact app design, a graphical user interface can be created that is every bit as engaging, intuitive and interactive as today's consumer applications. Completely control application behavior on different devices: You control how an application behaves on a given device. With automatic screen sizing, apps can look, feel and behave identically on all devices - or you can add new features or expand the presentation of existing features to take advantage of larger screens.

###Faster time to market
A simplified application development approach allows for shorter time to market than ever before.
